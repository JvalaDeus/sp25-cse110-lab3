            <h2>New Business</h2>
            <p>Allow teams to carry over their team page across seasons by updating the existing roster instead of
                creating a new page each year. Teams can simply add or remove players from the previous year’s roster,
                then publish it under a new name (e.g., Team Name 2025). This also enables easy access to historical
                stats by scrolling through past seasons. </p>
            <p>When setting lines, allow users to organize players by position (e.g., handler, cutter) or, for mixed
                teams, by gender. This makes it easier to build balanced lines and quickly select players during games.

            <h2>Miscellaneous Comments</h2>
            <p><b>Akhil:</b> I spoke with the captain of Skipjack and the coaches for the UCSD Air Squids and Dragon
                Coaliton. They’re both excited about our plans to revive UltiAnalytics, and offered to help promote it
                if we have a working release by the start of club season in early June.</p>
            <p>Katherine: Skipjack is a mid level men's club team, so I don't know how much impact they would have. But
                the DCos make nationals every year and are always a top 10 women's collegiate team, and the Air Squids
                are a top 50 collegiate mens team. So this would be a huge impact if they would advertise for us. </p>
            <p><i>Ruben:</i> Skipjack would still be huge. Skipjack is very well connected with other
                club teams, and they are stil fairly respected even if they dont usually make it to club nationals. So
                they could definetly help us get the word out to club teams. </p>
            <p><i>Eric:</i> That kind of exposure would be huge — we should try to make sure we can get a beta ready by
                the start of June</p>

                <summary>Team Concerns</summary>
                <p>We’ll need to finalize our core features soon to make that timeline realistic, maybe by
                    end of April and start implementation by the first weekend of May. </p>
